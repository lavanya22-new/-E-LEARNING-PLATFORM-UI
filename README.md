*DESCRIPTION*: TO DESIGN THE FRONT-END OF AN E-LEARNING PLATFORM WITH FEATURES LIKE COURSE LISTING, PROGRESS TRACKING, AND VIDEO EMBEDDING, WILL BREAK DOWN THE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS AND STRUCTURE NEEDED TO CREATE A USER-FRIENDLY, ENGAGING, AND INTUITIVE EXPERIENCE. HERE IS THE DESIGN STRUCTURE FOR THE FRONT-END, USING HTML, CSS, AND JAVASCRIPT, WHICH CAN LATER BE INTEGRATED WITH A BACKEND SYSTEM. KEY FEATURES: COURSE LISTING PAGE, COURSE DETAIL PAGE, PROGRESS TRACKING, VIDEO EMBEDDING, RESPONSIVE DESIGN. THE COURSE LISTING PAGE WILL DISPLAY ALL AVAILABLE COURSES WITH BRIEF DETAILS LIKE TITLE, IMAGE, AND A SHORT DESCRIPTION. EACH COURSE WILL BE CLICKABLE, LEADING TO THE COURSE DETAIL PAGE. THE COURSE DETAIL PAGE INCLUDES THE COURSE CONTENT, VIDEO EMBEDDING, A LIST OF MODULES, AND A PROGRESS TRACKER. THE PROGRESS TRACKER IN THE COURSE DETAIL PAGE VISUALLY DISPLAYS HOW MUCH OF THE COURSE HAS BEEN COMPLETED. IT USES A <PROGRESS> BAR ELEMENT FOR THIS PURPOSE. YOU CAN EMBED VIDEOS FROM PLATFORMS LIKE YOUTUBE OR VIMEO, AS SHOWN ABOVE IN THE IFRAME ELEMENT. TO ENSURE THAT THE PLATFORM LOOKS GOOD ON MOBILE AND DESKTOP, USE MEDIA QUERIES TO ADJUST THE LAYOUT. THIS FRONT-END DESIGN INCLUDES THE BASIC STRUCTURE FOR THE COURSE LISTING, DETAILS, VIDEO EMBEDDING, AND PROGRESS TRACKING. YOU CAN ENHANCE THIS WITH DYNAMIC ELEMENTS BY INTEGRATING A BACKEND FRAMEWORK (E.G., REACT, VUE.JS, OR ANGULAR), JAVASCRIPT, AND A BACKEND API (E.G., NODE.JS, DJANGO, ETC.) TO STORE DATA AND MANAGE USER AUTHENTICATION.
